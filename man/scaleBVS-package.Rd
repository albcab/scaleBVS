\title{Bayesian Variable Selection for the linear model via weighted Tempered Gibbs Sampling}
\description{
Perform Bayesian variable selection in linear regression contexts using discrete 
spike and slab priors. Posterior sampling and calculation of marginal Posterior 
Inclusion Probabilities (PIPs) for explanatory variables is done using the 
weighted Tempered Gibbs Sampling algorithm of Zanella and Roberts (2019).
}
\details{
Bayesian Variable Selection models provide a natural and coherent framework
to select a subset of explanatory variables in linear regression contexts. 
The binary inclusion variables for each regressor typically possess pairwise
and/or negative dependence structures conjectured to be conductive to 
successful application of weighted Tempered Gibbs Sampling (Zanella and Roberts, 2019).

The use of weighted Tempered Gibbs Sampling overcomes the challenges of
high-dimensional Bayesian Variable selection models by an efficient computation 
of the full conditional distribution of the binary inclusion probabilities.
These full conditionals allow for the calculation of Rao-Blackwellised 
estimators of the marginal Posterior Inclusion Probabilities for each regressor.
These estimates quantify the uncertainties of the true underlying
linear model.

This package has been concieved as an implementation of the weighted
Tempered Gibbs Sampling algorithm to Bayesian Variable Selection models in order
to sample from the distribution of its binary inclusion variables and provide
a formal Bayesian answer to variable selection problems.
